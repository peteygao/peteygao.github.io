_Recruiters: Nothing I say will deter you, so if you are to reach out, please do so at <a href='mailt&#111;&#58;r&#101;c%72uit&#64;%70eterg%&#54;1o%2E&#99;%&#54;F&#109;'>recr&#117;&#105;t&#64;peterg&#97;o&#46;com</a> and I will give you my highest priority and respond within 72 hours (I am not looking; prepare for a courteous rejection). Otherwise your email will be lost in the vast swaths of my inbox._

This is the web presence of Peter Gao. I write about technology, culture, leadership and various worldly trivia that I find worth remarking upon.

This space is meant to be a relaxing place for all readers, and the subject matter quality will be kept high. You are always free to say hello and tell me where I have erred (email below).
