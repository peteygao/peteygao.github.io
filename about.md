Inter Alia: Latin for "among other things".

This is the web presence of Peter Gao. I write about technology, culture, leadership and various worldly trivia that I find worth remarking upon.

This space is meant to be a relaxing place for all readers, and the subject matter quality will be kept high. You are always free to say hello and tell me where I have erred (email below).
